# merc_roster
Basic roster and attack rolls for troops in Tiglath's 268  game.

## How to use

You must have Python 3 installed on your computer. 
 - See "How to install Python" below if you do not have it already.

On the GitHub page (https://github.com/TheUnseenServant/merc_roster): 
  - Click the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP" 
  - Save the file to your computer, and then use your "unzip" program on it

This should give you a directory "merc_roster-master". Go into that directory.

On most systems you should be able to run:
  - For the troop roster:
    python merc_roster.py     
  - To make the attack rolls:
    python merc_roster.py -a

The program uses data files in ~/data; they are colon delimited. You can add
your own data, but the format of each file is structured and unforgiving.
