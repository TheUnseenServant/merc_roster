# merc_roster
Basic roster and attack rolls for troops in Tiglath's 268  game.

## How to use

You must have Python 3 installed on your computer.  

  * See "How to install Python" below if you do not have it already.  

On the GitHub page (https://github.com/TheUnseenServant/merc_roster):   

  * Click the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP"  
  * Save the file to your computer, and then use your "unzip" program on it  

This should give you a directory "merc_roster-master". Go into that directory.

On most systems you should be able to run:  

  * For the troop roster:     ``` python merc_roster.py  ```

  * To make the attack rolls:  ``` python merc_roster.py -a  ```

The program uses data files in ~/data; they are colon delimited. You can add
your own data, but the format of each file is structured and unforgiving.
